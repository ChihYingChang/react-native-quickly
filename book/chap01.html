<p>React Native apps are not the same as hybrid or so-called HTML5 apps. If you are not familiar with the hybrid approach, it’s when there’s a website wrapped in a headless browser. A headless browser is a browser view without the URL bar or navigation buttons. Basically, developers build responsive websites using regular web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and maybe a framework like jQuery Mobile, Ionic, Ember, or Backbone. Then they package it as a native app together with this headless browser. In the end you get to reuse the same code base across platforms, but the experience of using hybrid apps is often lacking. They are usually not as snappy, or lack certain features compared to native apps. Among the most popular frameworks for hybrid apps are Sencha Touch, Apache Cordova, PhoneGap, and Ionic.</p>

<p>A React Native app, on the other hand, is not a website wrapped in a headless browser. It’s native Objective C or Java code that communicates with React’s JavaScript. This allows for the following benefits over native development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hot/live reload. Developers can reload their apps without recompiling them, which speeds up development and eliminates the need for complex What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors and IDEs.</li>
  <li>Flexbox layout system. This is a synthesized system for layouts that is similar to CSS and allows for cross-platform development.</li>
  <li>Chrome debugging. Developers can use the already familiar DevTools.</li>
  <li>Write once and make it work across platforms.</li>
  <li>Port from web React easily, for example with frameworks like <a href="http://componentkit.org">ComponentKit</a>.</li>
  <li>Leverage the vast amount of open-source tools, utilities, libraries, knowledge, best practices, ES6/7+, and books on JavaScript (the most popular programming language in the world).</li>
  <li>Use native elements, which are better and more powerful than web tech (the HTML5/wrapper approach).</li>
  <li>React. No specific data binding, event management, or micromanaging of views, all of which tend to increase complexity. React uses a declarative approach and simple-to-scale unidirectional data flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, it’s no surprise that large and small companies alike are jumping on the React Native train and abandoning both hybrid and native approaches. Every day I read blog posts saying that such and such company or some iOS developer has switched to React Native, and how they are happy with the move. Are you ready to get started with what seems to be the next generation of mobile development?</p>
